C based game on FPGA board using VGA and nios 2

## Introduction: 
Pocket Tanks is a classic 2D artillery game where two tanks take turns firing projectiles at each other, trying to reduce the opponent's health to zero. The player can choose the power of their shot as well as adjust the horizontal position of their tank to aim. The game also includes a projectile that can bounce off walls and the ground, making it challenging to hit the opponent.
## Game Mechanics: 
Tank is based on physics and projectile motion mechanics. The projectile is fired at an initial velocity from the tank, and then moves in a parabolic path under the influence of gravity. The power of the shot determines the initial velocity of the projectile. The projectile also bounces off walls and the ground using the coefficient of restitution. The goal is to hit the opponent's tank with the projectile, and reduce their health points to zero.
## Conclusion: 
Tank wars is a fun and challenging game that combines physics mechanics and strategic gameplay. The ability to adjust the power and horizontal position of the tanks make the game more interesting. The addition of the projectile that can bounce off walls and terrain adds another layer of challenge to the gameplay. Overall, Tank Wars is an engaging game that is easy to learn but difficult to master.
